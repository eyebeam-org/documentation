Some general notes:

### General

**Left:** Taking the place of the "Eyebeam is changing" square – or both the "Eyebeam is changing" and "Support Eyebeam" squares if the `Full width` toggle is set.

#### Ambient Images

Images added here will be used randomly for pages that do not have a main image explicitly set.

#### Cities

Here you can set the cities where the current fellows live. These will be shown in the slide-down header. 

Note that you need to enter the timezone for each city in this format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
